# Watt_Intro_Dev_Proyecto_Final

In this project you'll find 3 HTML files:

  1. Index: Main view, where you'll find 3 main topics, what I've learned in this course, all that I've learned during this pandemic time, and finally, what I'll like to do in the future. 
  2. Biography: A little bit about me and my carrer. 
  3. Gallery: Some pictures, about my family, the hobbies that enjoy to do, and finally some trips that I've done. 
  
Also, you'll find a CSS file, with all the styles applied to each HTML. 

And finally, a JavaScript file, with the fuctions related to the gallery's buttons and biography's features. 

Thanks,
